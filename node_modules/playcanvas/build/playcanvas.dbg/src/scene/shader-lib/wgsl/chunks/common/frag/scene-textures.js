// The alpha is the fragment's coverage: opaque geometry passes 1.0, blended geometry (gaussian splats)
// its own alpha. What is accumulated is the reciprocal of the depth, pre-multiplied by that coverage, so
// that under the premultiplied blending the splats already use the attachment holds a coverage weighted
// average of the reciprocal - the weights sum to one on their own, with whatever coverage is left over
// falling to the value the attachment was cleared to. Clearing it to the reciprocal of the far clip
// therefore makes the background a surface at that distance, and averaging reciprocals rather than
// depths is what stops it dragging a partly covered pixel most of the way out to it. The read inverts
// the average back into a depth. Opaque geometry, passing 1.0, simply overwrites.
